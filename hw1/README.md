1. I shifted the toggle theme button to the left side of the screen. I removed the right margin from the '.nav__list' class, added a new class called '.rightmargin', and grouped the toggle theme button with the logo using a new <div> tag in the html file.

2. I added color highlights to my role and bio in the about section using the same <span> tag with the '.about__name' class.

3. I added a photos section to my webpage. There is a new 'Photos' tab in the navigation center that links to the photos section. In the actual photos section, I used the same '.section__title' class for formatting and linked a stock image of two dogs. I also added a '.img' class in styles.css to help format the stock image.
